# Quantum-Circuit-Solver-with-BlueQubit
Uses Qiskit and BlueQubit platform to solve circuits, with varying qubit size measurements, with quantum algorithms to identify hidden bitstrings in circuits with 30, 42, and 60 qubits. Uses BlueQubit's advanced quantum processing units (QPU) and GPU APIs for execution of code in a high-data rate Jupyter Notebook to handle large quantum datasets.

# How to Get Started
First, download the three circuit measurement files ".qasm" for each code solver. Note the directory and update the directory code line for your local storage. Obtain a BlueQubit API and insert it into the code. Step-by-step instructions for installing python packages and running a high data-rate Jupyter Notebook will be coming soon.
