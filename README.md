# Quantum-Circuit-Solver-with-BlueQubit
Uses Qiskit and BlueQubit platform to solve circuits, with varying qubit size measurements, with quantum algorithms to identify hidden bitstrings in circuits with 30, 42, and 60 qubits. Uses BlueQubit's advanced quantum processing units (QPU) and GPU APIs for execution of code in a high-data rate Jupyter Notebook to handle large quantum datasets.
